# ResellerUsagePeriod Auto-Creation on Payment Success

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**  
**Date**: September 30, 2025  
**Feature**: Automatic ResellerUsagePeriod creation when subscription payments succeed

---

## 🎯 **What Was Implemented**

The system now **automatically creates** a `ResellerUsagePeriod` when a reseller subscription payment succeeds, ensuring proper billing cycle alignment and immediate availability for usage tracking.

---

## 🔄 **Updated Flow**

### **Before (Old Flow)**
```
1. Reseller pays for subscription
2. Stripe webhook received
3. Subscription status updated
4. Transaction recorded
5. ❌ NO usage period created
6. Usage period only created on first call
```

### **After (New Flow)**
```
1. Reseller pays for subscription
2. Stripe webhook received
3. Subscription status updated
4. Transaction recorded
5. ✅ ResellerUsagePeriod created automatically
6. Ready for immediate usage tracking
```

## 📍 **Implementation Locations**

### **1. Payment Success Handler**
**File**: `app/Services/StripeService.php`  
**Method**: `handleResellerPaymentSucceeded()`

```php
// Create usage period for the new billing cycle
try {
    $usageTracker = new \App\Services\ResellerUsageTracker();
    $usagePeriod = $usageTracker->createUsagePeriod($localSubscription);
    
    Log::info('Reseller usage period created on payment success', [
        'subscription_id' => $subscriptionId,
        'reseller_id' => $localSubscription->reseller_id,
        'usage_period_id' => $usagePeriod->id,
        'period_start' => $usagePeriod->period_start,
        'period_end' => $usagePeriod->period_end,
    ]);
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    Log::error('Failed to create usage period on payment success', [
        'subscription_id' => $subscriptionId,
        'reseller_id' => $localSubscription->reseller_id,
        'error' => $e->getMessage(),
    ]);
}
```

### **2. Checkout Session Completed Handler**
**File**: `app/Services/StripeService.php`  
**Method**: `handleResellerCheckoutSessionCompleted()`

```php
// Create usage period for the new subscription
try {
    $usageTracker = new \App\Services\ResellerUsageTracker();
    $usagePeriod = $usageTracker->createUsagePeriod($subscription);
    
    Log::info('Reseller usage period created on checkout completion', [
        'subscription_id' => $subscriptionId,
        'reseller_id' => $resellerId,
        'usage_period_id' => $usagePeriod->id,
        'period_start' => $usagePeriod->period_start,
        'period_end' => $usagePeriod->period_end,
    ]);
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    Log::error('Failed to create usage period on checkout completion', [
        'subscription_id' => $subscriptionId,
        'reseller_id' => $resellerId,
        'error' => $e->getMessage(),
    ]);
}
```

### **3. Subscription Created Handler**
**File**: `app/Services/StripeService.php`  
**Method**: `handleResellerSubscriptionCreated()`

```php
// Create usage period if subscription is active
if ($localSubscription && $localSubscription->status === 'active') {
    try {
        $usageTracker = new \App\Services\ResellerUsageTracker();
        $usagePeriod = $usageTracker->createUsagePeriod($localSubscription);
        
        Log::info('Reseller usage period created on subscription creation', [
            'subscription_id' => $subscriptionData['id'],
            'reseller_id' => $resellerId,
            'usage_period_id' => $usagePeriod->id,
            'period_start' => $usagePeriod->period_start,
            'period_end' => $usagePeriod->period_end,
        ]);
    } catch (\Exception $e) {
        Log::error('Failed to create usage period on subscription creation', [
            'subscription_id' => $subscriptionData['id'],
            'reseller_id' => $resellerId,
            'error' => $e->getMessage(),
        ]);
    }
}
```

## 🎯 **When ResellerUsagePeriod is Created**

### **1. Initial Subscription Payment**
- **Trigger**: `checkout.session.completed` webhook
- **When**: Reseller completes payment for new subscription
- **Result**: Usage period created immediately

### **2. Recurring Payment Success**
- **Trigger**: `invoice.payment_succeeded` webhook
- **When**: Monthly/annual subscription payment succeeds
- **Result**: New usage period created for next billing cycle

### **3. Subscription Creation**
- **Trigger**: `customer.subscription.created` webhook
- **When**: Stripe subscription is created (if active)
- **Result**: Usage period created if status is 'active'

---

## 📊 **Usage Period Data**

### **Initial Values**
```php
'total_calls' => 0,
'total_duration_seconds' => 0,
'total_cost' => 0,
'overage_cost' => 0,
'overage_minutes' => 0,
'overage_status' => 'none',
'carried_forward_amount' => 0,
```

### **Period Dates**
- **`period_start`**: `subscription.current_period_start`
- **`period_end`**: `subscription.current_period_end`
- **Aligned with Stripe billing cycle**

### **Package Limits**
- **`monthly_cost_limit`**: Calculated from package settings
- **`monthly_minutes_limit`**: From package configuration
- **`extra_per_minute_charge`**: From package pricing

---

## 🔧 **Error Handling**

### **Graceful Degradation**
- If usage period creation fails, payment still succeeds
- Error is logged but doesn't break the payment flow
- Usage tracking will still work (creates period on first call)

### **Logging**
- **Success**: Detailed logs with period details
- **Failure**: Error logs with context for debugging
- **No Impact**: Payment processing continues normally

---

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: New Reseller Subscription**
1. Create reseller with package
2. Process payment via Stripe
3. **Expected**: Usage period created immediately
4. **Verify**: Check `reseller_usage_periods` table

### **Scenario 2: Recurring Payment**
1. Existing active subscription
2. Monthly payment succeeds
3. **Expected**: New usage period for next cycle
4. **Verify**: New period with updated dates

### **Scenario 3: Payment Failure**
1. Payment fails
2. **Expected**: No usage period created
3. **Verify**: Only created on successful payment

---

## 📈 **Benefits**

### **1. Immediate Availability**
- Usage tracking works from first call
- No delay waiting for first call to create period

### **2. Proper Billing Alignment**
- Periods align with Stripe billing cycles
- Accurate billing period tracking

### **3. Better User Experience**
- Resellers can see usage immediately
- Dashboard shows current period data

### **4. Reduced Complexity**
- No need to check for period existence on every call
- Cleaner webhook processing

---

## 🔍 **Verification**

### **Check Database**
```sql
-- Check if usage periods are created
SELECT 
    rup.id,
    rup.reseller_id,
    rup.period_start,
    rup.period_end,
    rup.total_calls,
    rup.total_cost,
    rup.created_at
FROM reseller_usage_periods rup
WHERE rup.reseller_id = 'your-reseller-id'
ORDER BY rup.created_at DESC;
```

### **Check Logs**
```bash
# Look for usage period creation logs
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep "usage period created"
```

### **Test API**
```bash
# Test current usage endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost/api/reseller/usage/current
```

---

## 🚀 **Production Deployment**

### **1. Deploy Code**
- Deploy updated `StripeService.php`
- No database changes needed

### **2. Test Webhooks**
- Send test webhook to verify period creation
- Check logs for success/error messages

### **3. Monitor**
- Watch for error logs
- Verify periods are created for new payments
