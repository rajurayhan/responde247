# Australian Phone Number Address Requirement Fix

## Issue Description

When trying to purchase Australian phone numbers from the Create Assistant page, users were getting this error:

```json
{
    "success": false,
    "message": "Failed to purchase phone number: [HTTP 400] Unable to create record: Phone Number Requires an Address but the 'AddressSid' parameter was empty."
}
```

## Root Cause

Twilio requires address verification for phone numbers in certain countries, including Australia. This is a regulatory compliance requirement. When purchasing Australian phone numbers, Twilio needs an `AddressSid` parameter to be provided, which links to a verified address in the Twilio account.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated TwilioService.php

- **Modified `purchaseNumber()` method** to accept a `$countryCode` parameter
- **Added country-specific error handling** for address requirements
- **Improved error messages** to guide users on next steps
- **Enhanced logging** for better debugging

### 2. Updated AssistantController.php

- **Added country code mapping** to convert country names to Twilio country codes
- **Pass country code** to the `purchaseNumber()` method
- **Extract country** from assistant metadata

### 3. Key Changes

#### TwilioService.php
```php
// Before
public function purchaseNumber($phoneNumber)

// After  
public function purchaseNumber($phoneNumber, $countryCode = 'US')
```

#### AssistantController.php
```php
// Get country code from metadata
$countryCode = 'US'; // Default to US
if (isset($data['metadata']['country'])) {
    $countryCodeMap = [
        'United States' => 'US',
        'United Kingdom' => 'GB',
        'Canada' => 'CA',
        'Australia' => 'AU',
        'New Zealand' => 'NZ',
        'Ireland' => 'IE'
    ];
    $countryCode = $countryCodeMap[$data['metadata']['country']] ?? 'US';
}

// Purchase with country code
$purchaseResult = $twilioService->purchaseNumber($request->selected_phone_number, $countryCode);
```

## Error Handling

The system now provides more specific error messages:

- **For address requirements**: "Address verification required for this country. For Australian numbers, please contact support to set up address verification in your Twilio account."
- **For unavailable numbers**: "Phone number is not available for purchase. Please select a different number from the available list."
- **For already owned numbers**: "Phone number is already owned by another account. Please select a different number."

## Countries Affected

The following countries require address verification:
- **Australia (AU)** - Requires address verification
- **United Kingdom (GB)** - May require address verification
- **Canada (CA)** - May require address verification
- **New Zealand (NZ)** - May require address verification
- **Ireland (IE)** - May require address verification

## Next Steps for Full Resolution

### For Users:
1. **Contact Support**: If you need Australian phone numbers, contact support to set up address verification in your Twilio account
2. **Use US Numbers**: For immediate testing, use US phone numbers which don't require address verification
3. **Alternative Countries**: Consider using numbers from countries that don't require address verification

### For Developers:
1. **Implement Address Management**: Add functionality to create and manage Twilio addresses
2. **Add Address UI**: Create interface for users to manage their addresses
3. **Address Validation**: Implement address validation and verification
4. **Country-Specific Logic**: Add more sophisticated country-specific handling

## Testing

### Test Australian Number Purchase:
1. Create an assistant with country set to "Australia"
2. Select an Australian phone number
3. The system will now provide a clear error message about address requirements

### Test US Number Purchase:
1. Create an assistant with country set to "United States"
2. Select a US phone number
3. The purchase should work normally

## Logging

Enhanced logging has been added to track:
- Country code being used for purchase
- Address requirement errors
- Purchase success/failure with country context

## Future Enhancements

1. **Address Management System**: Complete implementation of Twilio address management
2. **User Address Interface**: Allow users to manage their addresses through the UI
3. **Address Validation**: Implement address validation and verification
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Add more comprehensive regulatory compliance features
5. **Country-Specific UI**: Show different options based on selected country
